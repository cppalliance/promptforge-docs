# Install and Run

This chapter teaches you to get the gateway running on your machine: how to install it, how to start it with a config file and a profile, and how to confirm it is healthy. You do these things every time you bring the gateway up, so they are worth learning well.

## Install the binary

The gateway is a single binary named `promptforge-gateway`. It serves an OpenAI-shaped inference API. Install it with cargo:

````
cargo install gateway
````

Confirm the install by printing the version:

````
promptforge-gateway --version
````

## Start the gateway

Start the gateway by naming a config file and a profile:

````
promptforge-gateway --config gateway.toml --profile main
````

The `--config` flag gives the path to the config file. The `--profile` flag names the profile to activate. The gateway always starts from one config file and one active profile.

Startup is bind-first. The gateway opens its listener and answers health, status, progress, configuration, and every ready route immediately, then provisions models afterward as one queued boot command. Downloads, local model spawns, and the speech engine load all run inside that command while the gateway is already serving, and you can watch it on the status and progress endpoints. A configured model that is still loading answers 503 with the code `model_loading` until its provisioning finishes.

You can supply both values through environment variables instead of command-line arguments. The config path comes from `--config` or from `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_CONFIG`; the flag wins when both are set. The profile comes from `--profile`, then `PROMPTFORGE_PROFILE`, then the sibling state file the gateway keeps beside the config.

You can also start the gateway with no config file at all. When no `gateway.toml` exists beside the executable, in the working directory, or in the user profile's `.promptforge` directory, the first run writes a default config there - loopback-only on an OS-assigned port, with a fresh random bearer key and `trust_loopback = true` so callers on the same machine need no key - and boots from it. The generated file notes the caveat beside that line: on a shared machine any other OS account can then use the gateway, and `trust_loopback = false` requires the key from everyone. The generated config selects a profile named `default`, so a bare first boot needs no flags.

## The system tray

On a desktop system the gateway's face is the system tray. The icon shows the gateway's state, and its menu lists a status line, a Workshop item that launches the Workshop application when the installer laid it beside the gateway, a Settings item that opens the configuration UI in your browser, a Launch at Login toggle, and Quit. A gateway started at login never opens a browser or a window.

For servers and CI, `--no-tray` keeps the plain headless loop. In a tray-less environment, `--print-url` prints the Settings URL to stdout once the gateway is bound. `--browser` opens the Settings page in your default browser once bound; the installer uses it on a Gateway-only install's first run. Launching `promptforge-gateway` while one is already running never starts a second copy: it opens the running gateway's Settings page instead.

After every successful bind the gateway writes a gateway discovery file (`gateway.json` in the run directory under the state directory) that records its port, bearer key, and process id. PromptForge components read that file to attach to the running gateway instead of starting a second one, and a clean shutdown removes it.

## Check that it is healthy

Once the gateway is serving, probe its health endpoint:

````
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/health
````

GET /health needs no credentials. It always answers 200 while the gateway is serving.

Every /v1 route is authenticated with the shared bearer key from the config file. The address in this request is the `bind` value from the `[server]` section of the config file; `127.0.0.1:8081` is an example bind. A request with a wrong token is rejected with status 401 and error code `unauthorized`, from any peer:

````
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer wrong-token" http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/models
````

From the gateway's own machine you can leave the key out entirely. With the default `trust_loopback = true`, a loopback request that presents no credential is admitted:

````
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/models
````

This convenience has one cost: on a shared machine, any other OS account can use the gateway the same way, including reading upstream API keys from the admin config surface. Set `trust_loopback = false` in `[server]` to require the key from every caller. The configuration chapter covers the rule in full.

## Choose what to build

Build-time feature flags decide which capabilities exist in the binary. The flags `local`, `web-search`, `stt`, and `config-ui` are on by default. A headless build without `local` refuses any configuration that declares local models; the refusal happens at startup.

## Run it as a service on Linux

On Linux the release archive contains a sample systemd unit. The unit runs the gateway as a service with a fixed config path and profile, and restarts it automatically on failure:

````
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/promptforge-gateway --config /etc/promptforge/gateway.toml --profile main
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
````

The gateway holds vendor credentials, so run it as a dedicated unprivileged user. The sample unit does this with `DynamicUser=yes` and keeps state in a systemd-managed state directory (`StateDirectory=promptforge`).

## Watch the logs

A serving gateway logs to `gateway.log` in the `logs` directory under the state directory (`~/.promptforge/logs` on a default install) and mirrors the same stream to stdout. Startup rotates the previous run's log aside - `gateway.log` becomes `gateway.log.1` - and keeps five previous runs, deleting the oldest. Every record crosses a redaction pass before it reaches disk: bearer tokens, authorization and cookie header values, and `api_key` assignments are masked. The log location is never configurable, so a config failure still has somewhere to report itself.

Control log verbosity through the standard `RUST_LOG` environment filter. The speech library logs at warn level by default, so it stays quiet unless you ask for more.

Startup failures appear on stderr with the full cause chain: one `error:` line followed by one `caused by:` line per cause, and the same chain lands in the log file. Once the gateway is serving, the log shows the bound address. If you configured port 0, the log reports the real bound port.

## Inspect a failed run

When a gateway run fails before it can serve, `promptforge-gateway diagnostics` finds the evidence without any config knowledge. It prints a read-only JSON report: the state directory, the resolved config path and whether it exists, the current and retained log paths and which exist, the gateway discovery file, whether a gateway is running, and the version. It never serves, rotates a log, parses a config, or mutates the state directory, and it never prints secrets - no bearer key, environment value, config content, or log content. The generated config points at it in a comment.

## Stop the gateway

From the tray, choose Quit. From a script or another PromptForge component, send an authenticated POST to the `/shutdown` route with the bearer key; it answers 202 and then the server goes down. Under `--no-tray`, Ctrl-C stops the gateway cleanly. Every path drains in-flight requests before the exit.
